# Upgrade deployment components

(suggestion from Scott Lowe, ???)

something like: To upgrade to Kuma <current_version> your deployment must also run <component_name> <component_version_number>.

Plus any gotchas for upgrading component connections to CP/DPPs ???

Also Scott mentioned upgrading and CAs. Not sure where which content bits should go for upgrading.
